### This is a General Purpose Repository which will contain functions which may be used frequently by others

## The Requirements
If you wish to add a function of your own to this repository your function needs to fulfill a simple set of criterias
- It should be a general-purpose function, not designed for very unique or rare cases. For example, it should generate a random string without a specific format, rather than a format like "XXX-999".
- Your function should either be a new function or an improvement to an existing one. If there is already a similar version of your function in the repository, the more efficient one will be included.
- Your function doesn't need to handle incorrect parameter formats, such as attempting to push a string data type to a character data type parameter. However, it must address logical errors, such as being unable to generate 27 unique characters.
