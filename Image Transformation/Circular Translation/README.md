# Circular Translation
### To move an object in a circular path

- Based on Trignometry and Circle Properties
- Each point on a Circle forms a right angled triangle with the radius as the hypotenuse, You can use tignometry to find the x-offset and y-offset of the point with respect to the centre of the Circle
- In the code the x-offset (w.r.t Centre) is written as ```newX``` and the y-offset (w.r.t Centre) is written as ```newY```
- In the code the variables ```x-offset``` and ```y-offset``` are used for setting the offset of the object being translated from any point on the Circle

#### Parameter Description
  1. degrees : An integer value for the Angle of the point on the Circle from 0 at the Centre of the Circle
      - 0 is to the left of the Centre
  2. radius  : It is the length of the Radius of the Circle
      - The unit of radius is the same as that of the x-offset and y-offset produced which is Pixels
  3. centre  : It is the location of the Centre of the Circle
